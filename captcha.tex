\begin{abstract}

CAPTCHA is a standard secure mechanism to automated tell computers and humans, and is applied to prevent against malicious bot programs.
Current text-based Captcha mechanism combines many anti-segmentation and anti-recognition features such as sophisticated noisy background,
character rotation, distortion and overlapping. Such mechanism is widely deployed by Google, Microsoft, Baidu, Alibaba. Many attacks on
text-based Captcha have been proposed. However, most of these fine prior works focus on a unique Captcha mechanism, making them have a
limited applicability. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel generic attack on current text-based Captcha. We employ the Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to translate the original Captcha to the regular one. Using the translated regular Captcha to train a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, our approach is able to accurately identify the Captcha. We thoroughly evaluated our approach
using real-world Captchas, and achieve a success rate of over XX with an average speed of 76ms on an ordinary server (with a 3.2-GHz Inter
Xeon CPU with 100-GB RAM and a TITAN Xp GPU). We discovered that, the Captcha with complex noisy background do not defend against
segmentation under our attack. This is demonstrated by the fact that we are able to remove the complex background from the Captcha image.
Since our attack can identify a widely text-based Captchas, this paper calls the community to revisit the risks of using text-based Captcha
to defend against malicious bots.
