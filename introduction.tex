\section{Introduction}

1. CPATCHAs are computer-generated tests that humans can pass but current computer systems cannot. CAPTCHAs provide a method for automatically distinguishing a human from a computer program, and therefore can protect Web services from abuse by so-called "bots".

most CAPTCHAs consist of distorted images, usually text, for which a user must provide some description. 

CAPTCHAs can distinguish between humans and computers with high probability, they are used for many different security applications: they prevent bots from voting continuously in online polls, automatically registering for millions of spam email accounts, automatically purchasing tickets to buy out an event, etc~\cite{Tam2008Breaking}.
