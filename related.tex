The Automated Turing Tests were first proposed by Naor~\cite{Naor1996Verification}, but they did not provide a formal definition. Lillibridge \emph{et al.}~\cite{Lillibridge2001Method} developed the first practical Automated Turing Test to prevent bots from automatically registering web pages. This system was effective for a while and then was defeated by common Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.

Text-based Captchas based on English letters and Arabic numerals, is still the most widely deployed scheme. Many research communities focus on developing attack approaches for existing text-based Captchas, and then explore guidelines for better designs.
